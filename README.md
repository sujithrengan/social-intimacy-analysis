# Social Intimacy Analysis

## Training
Training arguments and hyperparameters can be configured via `Args` and `Config`. 

`Args` hold parameters about the model and dataset paths:
```python
class Args:
    model_name # Model Name used for saving output
    pre_trained_model_name_or_path # Pretrained model name on ðŸ¤—
    train_path # Path to train dataset .txt file
    val_path # Path to validation dataset .txt file
    test_path # Path to test dataset .txt file
    model_saving_path # Path to save model outputs
```

`Config` holds parameters for training:
```python
class Config:
    max_epochs # Number of epochs for training
    lr # Learning rate 
    batch_size # Batch size
    cuda # Enable CUDA
    max_len # Maximum length of tweets/ posts
    warmup_ratio # Warmup for percentage of total training steps
    weight_decay # Weight Decay
    gradient_accumulation_steps # Accumulate gradients over steps/batches
    adam_epsilon # Epsilon to use in Adam optimizer
```
